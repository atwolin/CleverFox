Water shortage has been a serious problem for many years and has caused various crises. The land is being crushed by overuse of underground water, and many people are unable to access enough water, crowding around water carts like thirsty animals. All of this sounds horrible. Climate change is the biggest cause of environmental problems. Earth has been getting hotter and hotter in recent years, leading to extremely hot climates. The lack of typhoons and reduced rainfall both contribute to water shortages. Ultimately, the problems mentioned above are all a result of our own actions, and the only solution is to address them. From now on, let's save water whenever possible, improve education, and cherish our mother earth. I hope the world will become better.
