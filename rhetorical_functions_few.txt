    Another is amplifying with phrases, such as "moreover", "furthermore", "besides" and so on.
    For example:
        There was more than enough to do in repairing the faults of the existing system and correcting the injustices of the past. [[Moreover,]] the reforms had to be achieved with resources severely diminished by the efforts of war.
        Science cannot provide that kind of certainty. [[Furthermore,]] it is often overlooked that we can only apply the scientific method to a tiny fraction of the impressions upon which we act.

B. Describing Similarities/Differences:
    For this function, there are two types. 
    One is comparing similarities with phrases, such as "similarity", "similar", "resemble", "correspond", "likewise", "similarly" and so on.
